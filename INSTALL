                              Building Hercules Studio from source
                              ------------------------------------

Building Hercules Studio from source is a fairly straightforward process, but it does require some knowledge in software building. 
If you prefer, you can use the pre-compiled binaries available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/hercstudio/files/ .

1. Prerequisites: you should already have a c++ compiler and the rest of the tool chain. It is recommended to install
   all the necessary tools using the distribution-supplied packge: 
   On debian/ubuntu do: sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git
   On RedHat/Fedora do: sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"

   In addition, you should have the Qt development framework from a release above 6.2.0. Your distribution should have this package ready. 
   On debian/ubuntu do: sudo apt-get install qt6-base-dev
   On RedHat/Fedora do: sudo dnf install qt6-qtbase-devel

2. clone the repository:
   git clone git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/hercstudio/git-code hercstudio

3. Enter the top hercstudio directory:
    $ cd hercstudio

4. Run cmake:
    $ cmake -B build .

4. Start the build:
    $ cd build && make

5. Install Hercules Studio (as root):
    $ make install
